### Hi there 👋

I'm Cristy and spend most of my time working on iOS development with Swift. I have 5 years of experience developing iOS apps, and will happily do it for the rest of my life. 👩🏻‍💻♥️📱

⚡️ I wake up every day excited to learn and apply more of what iOS dev has to offer, and if there's something you think I should learn, I'd love to hear and learn from you! 💬
